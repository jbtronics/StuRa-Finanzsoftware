/**
 * This entity represents a request to pay money for something to a persons bank account.
 * The applicant (which can be some other person than the payment receiver) submits a payment order ("Zahlungsauftrag")
 * via the front end form. The finance officers of the department for which the payment order was submitted receive an
 * email with a verification link where they have to confirm the payment oder.
 * In the backend the back office officers can see all submitted payment orders. In the first step it is checked if a
 * payment order is factually correct, then it is exported (as SEPA-XML) to the online banking system. Another officer
 * then checks if the payment order is factually correct and then approve the payment in the online banking.
