 * This entity represents a request to pay money for something to a persons bank account.

 * In the backend the back office officers can see all submitted payment orders. In the first step it is checked if a
 * payment order is factually correct, then it is exported (as SEPA-XML) to the online banking system. Another officer
 * then checks if the payment order is factually correct and then approve the payment in the online banking.
